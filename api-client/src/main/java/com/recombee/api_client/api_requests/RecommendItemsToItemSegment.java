 * Recommends Items that are the most relevant to a particular Segment from a context [Segmentation](https://docs.recombee.com/segmentations.html).
 * Based on the used Segmentation, this endpoint can be used for example for:
 * - Recommending articles related to a particular topic
 * - Recommending songs belonging to a particular genre
 * - Recommending products produced by a particular brand
 * You need to set the used context Segmentation in the Admin UI in the [Scenario settings](https://docs.recombee.com/scenarios) prior to using this endpoint.
 * The returned items are sorted by relevance (the first item being the most relevant).
 * It is also possible to use the POST HTTP method (for example, in the case of a very long ReQL filter) â€” query parameters then become body parameters.
