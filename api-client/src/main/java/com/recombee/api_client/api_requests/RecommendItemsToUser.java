/**
 * Based on the user's past interactions (purchases, ratings, etc.) with the items, recommends top-N items that are most likely to be of high value for the given user.
 * The most typical use cases are recommendations on the homepage, in some "Picked just for you" section, or in email.
 * The returned items are sorted by relevance (the first item being the most relevant).
 * Besides the recommended items, also a unique `recommId` is returned in the response. It can be used to:
 * - Let Recombee know that this recommendation was successful (e.g., user clicked one of the recommended items). See [Reported metrics](https://docs.recombee.com/admin_ui.html#reported-metrics).
 * - Get subsequent recommended items when the user scrolls down (*infinite scroll*) or goes to the next page. See [Recommend Next Items](https://docs.recombee.com/api.html#recommend-next-items).
 * It is also possible to use POST HTTP method (for example in the case of a very long ReQL filter) - query parameters then become body parameters.
